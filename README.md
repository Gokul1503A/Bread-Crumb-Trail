A simulation of Bread Crumb Trail algorithm to make the vehicle move autonomusly in fixed path like agriculture fields

In train.py file vehicle can be controlled using arrow keys and pressing 's' on keyboard saves the path 

The coordinates of the vehicle is stored in .txt file 

In show_path.py the path travelled by the vehicle in the field will shown as bread crumbs on the field 

In simulate.py the vehicle automatically moves along the path saved while training
